        I am currently a third year PhD student in <a href="https://www.rit.edu/computing/study/computing-and-information-sciences-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computing and Information Science</a> at <a href="https://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)</a>. I am a part of the Lab of Use-Inspired Computational Intelligence (LUCI) where I work under the supervision of <a href="https://ruililuci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Rui Li</a>. Before starting my PhD, I completed my undergraduate in <a href="http://doece.pcampus.edu.np/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Electronics and Communication Engineering</a> at <a href="https://pcampus.edu.np/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulchowk Campus, IOE</a>, Nepal.

    <h2>
 <b>Research</b>
 </h2>
 My research focuses on developing Bayesian framework that allows deep learning models to dynamically adapt their structures in light of data. Currently, I am engaged in developing model selection frameworks for different learning scenarios like supervised/unsupervised learning, graph learning, and federated learning. <br>
    <b>Interests: </b> Statistical Machine Learning, Bayesian Methods, Bayesian Model Selection in Deep Learning, Deep Graph Learning, Federated Learning
